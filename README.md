# Snake in Matlab
This repository contains a classic Snake game implemented in MATLAB. The Snake game is a popular arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it eats food, while avoiding collisions with obstacles and itself. The game was developed as a fun project to demonstrate graphical capabilities and basic game logic using MATLAB.
